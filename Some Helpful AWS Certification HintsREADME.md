[AWS Certification]: <https://www.netcomlearning.com/vendors/aws-training.phtml?advid=1356>

A significant amount of work is yet to be completed for individuals who have committed to getting certified. However, owing to Amazon, this task has lately become much easier to do. Amazon launched its training and certification program earlier this year.
As stated in this AWS blog article; “Previously, you had to search and manage training and certification offers across various websites. You now have a single location where you can locate and enroll in AWS Training, register for AWS Certification tests, manage your learning progress, and get advantages depending on your AWS Certifications.”

## So, what advice do our experts offer for the AWS certification process?

### 1. Be prepared to make a complete commitment.
Versant’s Hull rapidly discovered that you couldn’t be half-hearted when it comes to AWS certification. “My first exam immediately after entering the firm was a fail,” he admits. “I saw this as a message that I needed to devote a significant amount of effort to learning/understanding as many of the AWS services as possible.” And that is just what he did.
I spent a significant amount of my energy and time over a year studying to fill in the gaps in my knowledge — mock examinations are accessible and provided me a fair idea of how I was progressing. I spent nine months experimenting with the AWS platform daily, and once I was ready to. I also allowed myself time between examinations to work on the sections of the exams that I found difficult.”

### 2. Make use of resources
According to specialists, there are several resources available to capitalize on; it is only a matter of selecting the ones that appeal to your learning tastes and provide the most value. Technical Bootcamps are an excellent way to remain current as they give hands-on learning and help us retain skills that we can apply to our custom designs, lead by AWS knowledge experts.

### 3. Use AWS to solve issues.
For the examinations, you need to get into an AWS mentality as they contain a lot of practical situations, and many are discreetly attempting to push towards the correct answer, with a mention of performance, cost, or global reach. As with any technological challenge, there are various solutions available based on the tools and resources at your disposal. AWS has several alternatives, but you must determine not just what the test question is asking, but also what the ‘AWS Way’ of answering the question is.

### 4. Determining the best moment
With more opportunities and a more significant salary raise on the line, it may be tempting to hurry through the AWS certification process. However, rushing into it may cause more harm than benefit. Because certification requires a significant time commitment, you must pursue it at the appropriate point in your professional career.
You can continuously push the boundaries of what the platform must offer in terms of existing and new product sets.

Obtaining AWS certification is a good decision for nearly anybody in the IT industry. However, doing so necessitates your absolute dedication, so determining an opportune moment to begin the training is just as crucial as deciding to do it in the first place.
One thing is sure: AWS isn’t going backward, and with certification on your side, you won’t either.
